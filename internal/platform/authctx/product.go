// called dashboard, notifications, reports, masterData and customer meaning
// entirely different things. Every entitlement and permission is therefore
// qualified by product, and a service declares which one it is at startup.

	// which the client reads as undefined and renders as an empty list.

	// Feature is the company entitlement that gates this permission — and it
	// is NOT derivable from the key.

	// This is the part most likely to be got wrong by assumption. In FMS,
	// `fuel.view` is gated by the `live` feature, `dashboard.ai` by
	// `ai_dashboard`, `reports.custom` by `custom_report`, and
	// `dashcams.manage` by `camera`. Splitting the key on its dot and treating
	// the prefix as the feature would gate several permissions against
	// entitlements that do not exist, silently denying everyone.
	//
	// Empty means UNGATED: the permission needs no entitlement, only the user
	// grant. FMS uses this for its master-data and administration surface —
	// managing vehicles, drivers, users and roles is always available to a
	// company that has the product at all.
