package authctx

// The FMS permission catalogue, mirroring the live production catalogue in the
// FMS codebase.
//
// Note how often the gating feature differs from the key's prefix — fuel.* is
// gated by `live`, dashboard.ai by `ai_dashboard`, dashcams.manage by `camera`.
// That indirection is the reason PermissionSpec carries Feature explicitly
// rather than deriving it.
//
// An empty Feature means the permission is always available to a company that
// has FMS at all: the master-data and administration surface.
//
// This must stay in step with the FMS service. It is duplicated rather than
// shared for the same reason everything else here is; see the note on
// internal/platform in the repository README.
