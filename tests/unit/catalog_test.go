// is raised anywhere: the key simply never matches, for everyone, forever.

// independently; this test is the comparison.

// TestFMSMirrorMatchesUpstream compares the vendored FMS registry against the

// The FMS half of the feature registry is a copy of a list another team owns.
// A copy drifts: rename a feature there and a token minted here goes on
// describing an entitlement that no longer exists, and every FMS permission
// gated by it starts failing for reasons that point at the wrong repository.
//
// The authority is fms-features.json at the root of the FMS module, which is a
// generated `json.MarshalIndent(features.Registry)` — derived from their Go
// source by `go generate`, never hand-edited. Comparing against the artifact
// rather than parsing their source means this test does not break every time
// they reformat a literal, and it is the same file a CI step can fetch.
//
// The check is skipped rather than failed when FMS is not checked out, because
// a TMS developer with no reason to have that repository should not be blocked
// by its absence. That makes this a local safety net, not a guarantee. Closing
// that gap needs the artifact fetched in CI rather than read from a sibling
